# Software Development Project 2

**(Test-Driven Development and Graphical User Interface Programming)**


## Scenario

Pizza Palace is a restaurant in West End, Brisbane. Last year, they had a group of students from Kingsland University of Technology develop a logging system that recorded orders placed at their restaurant. They would now like to produce a system that interprets the logs and displays the information on a Graphical User Interface (GUI).


## Getting Started

* **src**: This directory contains all the source code.  asgn2Customers, asgn2Pizzas, asgn2Resurant, asgn2GUis, asgn2Wizards packages as well as test code in the asgn2Tests package.
* **doc**: This directory contains the API. It has been generated using the Javadoc tool on a complete system.
* **logs**: This directory contains some test logs.
* **libs**: This directory contains the libraries for JUnit and Hamcrest.


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install:

```
Java Development Kit (JDK)
Eclipse editor
```

## Running the tests

The test classes will be executed on a series of defective solutions to ensure that they adequately detect programming errors. The unit tests are deemed to have detected a programming error in a defective program if more of the tests fail when applied to the defective program than when the tests are applied to our ‘ideal’ solution.

To assess the unit tests defective solutions will be executed against the following classes:

* asgn2.CustomerFactoryTests
* asgn2.CustomerTests
* asgn2.LogHandlerCustomerTests • asgn2.RestaurantCustomerTests
* asgn2.PizzaFactoryTests
* asgn2.PizzaTests
* asgn2.LogHandlerPizzaTests • asgn2.RestaurantPizzaTests


## Built With
